# Flappy-Bird
A Flappy Bird game enhanced with Reinforcement Learning

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pickle
- pygame

## How to Run
To begin the training process, run `python3 main.py`, which should open up the pygame window. By default, the game will use the 'qtable-1588369260.pickle' to determine the actions of the agent. This table has been created and saved by previous traning on the agent, and running the program will further improve agent. If you want to start the training process from scratch, simply delete this file from your directory and the agent will generate a random table and train from there.
